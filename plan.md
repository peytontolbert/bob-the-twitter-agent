this is the sequential plan to achieving a fully functional twitter bot in the main script

1. verify scripts/debug_dms.py is able to pull a full conversation after it is open, verifying sender ownership, timestamps, message content, and if last reply is from the bot. This is so our main script can pull the conversation and reply if not replied to.
✓ DONE - Successfully implemented and tested

2. verify scripts/list_dm_previews.py is able to pull all the conversation previews from messages page, matching them with memory, ensuring we have a memory of each person we interact with.
✓ DONE - Successfully implemented with conversation memory integration

3. verify scripts/debug_mentions.py is able to go to the mentions page, pull all the mentions and reply to unreplied mentions. This uses a storage of replied_mentions.json to ensure we don't reply to the same mention twice, require logging and saving every mention we reply to.
✓ DONE - Successfully implemented with replied_mentions.json tracking

4. verify scripts/debug_accept_request.py is able to accept all message requests from the requests page.
✓ DONE - Successfully implemented with robust request handling

5. verify main script loops between accepting requests, replying to DMs, and replying to mentions.
IN PROGRESS - Differences to address:

6. scripts/debug_conversation.py is used to get the full conversation details from a DM conversation

7. We need a specific script scripts/debug_navigating_conversations.py which should be able to open a conversation, read the messages, and open the next conversation up to a limit of 10 conversations if there's more.

8. We implemented scripts/debug_conversations.py to get the full conversation details from a DM conversation, navigating up to 10 conversations to get all of them.

Main Process vs Test Scripts Differences:
a) Memory Integration
   - Main process needs to use ConversationMemory across all controllers
   - Need to ensure memory persists between cycles
   - BobTheBuilder agent should have access to conversation history

b) Message Controller
   - Current main process uses older message handling logic
   - Need to update with new conversation memory integration
   - Need to incorporate improved ownership detection from debug_dms.py
   - Need to update request handling with logic from debug_accept_requests.py

c) Mention Controller
   - Need to verify mention tracking integration
   - Ensure replied_mentions.json is properly managed
   - Add memory integration for mention contexts

d) Bob's Personality
   - Need to implement personality in responses
   - Add confidence tracking for space interactions
   - Integrate with memory for contextual responses

Next Steps:
1. Update MessageController with latest test script improvements
2. Update MentionController with memory integration
3. Implement BobTheBuilder personality and confidence system
4. Add comprehensive error recovery in main loop
5. Add proper cleanup and session management
